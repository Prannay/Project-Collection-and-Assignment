#Project Collection and Assignment
This is a SaaS application based on Ruby on Rails for projects collection and assignment to be used by faculty members at TAMU and other universities. The application uses Bi-Partite Maximum Matching algorithm to solve the problem of project allocation to student groups. The solution provides a platform for customers to submit projects; students to form groups and provide project preferences; and Administrator to audit projects and use the allocation algorithm to assign projects to students. We used REST APIs of Rails and MVC framework. The website is live at https://projectassign.herokuapp.com.

Prannay Jain: I took ownership of modules like signup, login, pre-assignment etc. I was also responsible for the final demo video. For sign up and login I used all kind of validity checks of credentials, session cookie, hashing for storing passwords safely, indexing for faster look up. Preassignment means assignment of the projects to the teams who have privately talked to the customer and want to take this particular project only. This team is not interested in the projects uploaded by other customers.
